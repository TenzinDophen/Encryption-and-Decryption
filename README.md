# Encryption-and-Decryption
# This program uses doubly circular linked noded to store numbers from 1 to 28, representing two set of suits of a deck of cards and two 
# jokers which are represented as 27 and 28 repsectively. 
# The doubly circular linked node makes it very convenient to move around the items and swap their places without siginificantly having to # do more jobs. 
# There are several methods which does different swaps and a method which calls all the steps to get a final value
# The Encryption class encrpts messages and store them in a a form of integer values and the Decrption method decrypts the messgaes

# Hope to use generic classes and have it working for strings and other classes. 
# Make it more efficient and avoid code redundancy
